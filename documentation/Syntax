Programming Prefixes:
c – char
i – int
p – pointer
str – string

Programming Suffixes:
_t – type

Examples:
cdata = character named data
idata = integeter named data
pcdata = pointer to cdata

Example Code Block:
if (code) {
    Code block
}

Keep code, characters, integers, pointers, and functions in the lower case if possible.

Doxygen syntax
/// Allow for commenting on single lines
/** to comment multiple lines

Explination: These standards will make the code more human readable and therefore easier to debug

For example the prefixes and suffixes make information about the type of variable avaluble in the name so a programmer looking 
at the code doesn't need to look for the definition to find out what a variable is, this saves a lot of time in the long run.

While coding the prefixes can make it easier to put variables into the code because if all the ints start with 'i' you only
need to type 'i' and a dropdown menue will appear with all the integer variables avaluble for use where you are coding.
